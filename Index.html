        <h1>About Me/Artist Statment</h1>
        <p> Hi, all my name is Lee. I'm a New Media, and Metalsmithing artist from a small town in south <br> 
            Texas called Brenham, If you know about blue bell Ice cream that's where its from. I like to push<br>
             art to the extreme and just try to have fun while trying out completely different and new things. <br>
              In my art journey so far I have also become very fond of screen printing as well. I'm currently in my <br>
               junior year of college and hope to design video game models when I graduate. Some of my <br>
                favorite projects I've made are a 3D Modeled Castle, and a life sized trident.  </p>

        <h1> New Media</h1>
        <p> New Media is my major at UNT, <br>
            I've learnt a lot of different skills from my major <br>
        such as 3D Modeling, coding, video editing, and animation <br>
        i'm excited to expand even more and learn how to combine <br>
    these medians together to make something great </p>

        <h1> ScreenPrinting </h1>
        <p> Screenprinting was one of those classes that I took <br>
        because I thought it would be fun, but I never <br>
    imagined that I would actually like it much, due to how <br>
tedious it is, but I actually really enjoy it, as it allowed <br>
me to create my own anime series. </p>
